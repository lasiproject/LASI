    /// The type based pattern matching functionality was introduced to solve the problem of performing subtype dependent operations which
    /// could not be described by traditional virtual method approaches in an expressive or practical manner. There are several reasons for
    /// this. First and most important, is that the virtual method approach is limited to single dispatch* . Secondly different binding
    /// operations must be chosen based on a variety of information gathered from contexts which are often external to the single instance
    /// of the type representing a lexical construct. Different numbers and types of arguments that depend on the surrounding context of the
    /// lexical instance cannot be specified in a manner compatible with virtual method signatures. However, a linear storage and traversal
    /// mechanism for lexical elements of differing syntactic types, as well as the need to define types representing elements having
    /// overlapping syntactic roles, remains a necessity which prevents the complete stratification of class and interface hierarchies.
    /// There were a variety of solutions that were considered:
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// 1. A visitor pattern could be implemented such that the an object traversing a sequence of lexical elements would be passed in turn
    ///    to each, and by carrying with it sufficient and arbitrary context and by providing an overload for every syntactic type, could
    ///    provide functionality to implement operations between elements. There are several drawbacks involved including increased state
    ///    dispersal, increased class coupling, the maintenance cost of re factoring types, the need to define new classes, which carry
    ///    arbitrary algorithm state with them but must exist in their own hierarchy, and other factors generally increasing complexity.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// 2. A more flexible, visitor-like pattern could be implemented by taking advantage of dynamic dispatch and runtime overload
    ///    resolution. This has the drawback of the code not clearly expressing its semantics statically as it essentially relies on the
    ///    runtime to describe control flow, never stating it explicitly.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// 3. Describe traversal algorithms using complex, nested tiers of conditional blocks determined by the results of type casts. This is
    ///    error prone, unwieldy, ugly, and obscures the logic with noise. Additionally this approach may be inconsistently applied in
    ///    different section of code, causing the implementations of algorithms so written to be prone to subtle errors**.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The pattern matching implemented here abstracts over the type checking logic, allowing it to be tested and optimized for the large
    /// variety of algorithms in need of such functionality, allows for subtype constraints to be specified, allows for algorithms to handle
    /// as many or as few types as needed, and emphasizes the intent of the code which leverage it. It also eliminates the difficulty of
    /// defining state-full visitors by defining a match with a particular subtype as a function on that type. Such a function is
    /// intuitively specified as an anonymous closure which implicitly captures any state it will use. This approach also encourages the
    /// localization of logic, which in the case of visitors would not possible as implementations of visitors will inherently get spread
    /// out in both the textual space of the source code and the conceptions of implementers. The syntax for pattern matching uses a fluent
    /// interface style.
    /// </para>
    /// <example>
    /// <code>
    ///  var weight = myLexical.Match()
    ///     .Case((IReferencer r) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(r.ReferredTo.Weight))
    ///     .Case((IEntity e) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(e.Weight))
    ///     .Case((IVerbal v) =&gt; Console.WriteLine(v.HasSubject()? v.Subject.Weight : 0));

    /// <para>
    /// When a Yield clause is not applied, the Match Expression will not yield a value. Instead it will behave much as a Type driven switch
    /// statement. <example>
