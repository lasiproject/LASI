        /// The type based pattern matching functionality was introduced to solve the problem of performing subtype dependent operations which could not be described by traditional virtual method
        /// approaches in an expressive or practical manner. There are several reasons for this. First and most important, is that the virtual method approach is limited to single dispatch* . Secondly
        /// different binding operations must be chosen based on a variety of information gathered from contexts which are often external to the single instance of the type representing a lexical
        /// construct. Different numbers and types of arguments that depend on the surrounding context of the lexical instance cannot be specified in a manner compatible with virtual method signatures.
        /// However, a linear storage and traversal mechanism for lexical elements of differing syntactic types, as well as the need to define types representing elements having overlapping syntactic
        /// roles, remains a necessity which prevents the complete stratification of class and interface hierarchies. There were a variety of solutions that were considered:
        /// </para>
        /// <para>
        /// 1. A visitor pattern could be implemented such that the an object traversing a sequence of lexical elements would be passed in turn to each, and by carrying with it sufficient and arbitrary
        ///    context and by providing an overload for every syntactic type, could provide functionality to implement operations between elements. There are several drawbacks involved including increased
        ///    state dispersal, increased class coupling, the maintenance cost of re factoring types, the need to define new classes, which carry arbitrary algorithm state with them but must exist in their
        ///    own hierarchy, and other factors generally increasing complexity.
        /// </para>
        /// <para>
        /// 2. A more flexible, visitor-like pattern could be implemented by taking advantage of dynamic dispatch and runtime overload resolution. This has the drawback of the code not clearly expressing
