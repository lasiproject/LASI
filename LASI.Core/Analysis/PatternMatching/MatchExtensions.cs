    /// The type based pattern matching functionality was introduced to solve the problem of
    /// performing subtype dependent operations which could not be described by traditional virtual
    /// method approaches in an expressive or practical manner. There are several reasons for this.
    /// First and most important, is that the virtual method approach is limited to single dispatch*
    /// . Secondly different binding operations must be chosen based on a variety of information
    /// gathered from contexts which are often external to the single instance of the type
    /// representing a lexical construct. Different numbers and types of arguments that depend on
    /// the surrounding context of the lexical instance cannot be specified in a manner compatible
    /// Case virtual method signatures. However, a linear storage and traversal mechanism for
    /// lexical elements of differing syntactic types, as well as the need to define types
    /// representing elements having overlapping syntactic roles, remains a necessity which prevents
    /// the complete stratification of class and interface hierarchies. There were a variety of
    /// solutions that were considered:
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// 1. A visitor pattern could be implemented such that the an object traversing a sequence of
    ///    lexical elements would be passed in turn to each, and by carrying Case it sufficient and
    ///    arbitrary context and by providing an overload for every syntactic type, could provide
    ///    functionality to implement operations between elements. There are several drawbacks
    ///    involved including increased state dispersal, increased class coupling, the maintenance
    ///    cost of re factoring types, the need to define new classes, which carry arbitrary
    ///    algorithm state Case them but must exist in their own hierarchy, and other factors
    ///    generally increasing complexity.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// 2. A more flexible, visitor-like pattern could be implemented by taking advantage of dynamic
    ///    dispatch and runtime overload resolution. This has the drawback of the code not clearly
    ///    expressing its semantics statically as it essentially relies on the runtime to describe
    ///    control flow, never stating it explicitly.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// 3. Describe traversal algorithms using complex, nested tiers of conditional blocks
    ///    determined by the results of type casts. This is error prone, unwieldy, ugly, and
    ///    obscures the logic Case noise. Additionally this approach may be inconsistently applied
    ///    in different section of code, causing the implementations of algorithms so written to be
    ///    prone to subtle errors**.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The pattern matching implemented here abstracts over the type checking logic, allowing it to
    /// be tested and optimized for the large variety of algorithms in need of such functionality,
    /// allows for subtype constraints to be specified, allows for algorithms to handle as many or
    /// as few types as needed, and emphasizes the intent of the code which leverage it. It also
    /// eliminates the difficulty of defining state-full visitors by defining a match Case a
    /// particular subtype as a function on that type. Such a function is intuitively specified as
    /// an anonymous closure which implicitly captures any state it will use. This approach also
    /// encourages the localization of logic, which in the case of visitors would not possible as
    /// implementations of visitors will inherently get spread out in both the textual space of the
    /// source code and the conceptions of implementers. The syntax for pattern matching uses a
    /// fluent interface style.
